**1. Do you think ROS is beneficial for developing a robotic application? Explain your answer.**

I believe that ROS is beneficial for developing a robotic application because it provides you with simulation tools that allows you to test your code without the need to have an actual real life robot. ROS also has tons of documentation that can aid you when developing your robots

**2. Why is using a simulator important in Robotics?**

It allows you to easily test your code/design without the need of having an actual robot on hand. This significantly reduces any chances of there being a flaw in your system when your application is eventually deployed to a real-life robot. 

**3. Briefly describe the RoboMaker platform. Also, list its strength and weak points in your personal opinion.**

RoboMaker is a development environment that allows you to create and run robotic application code. Some of the strengths are that it comes with many sample applications that you can use as a starting point and from my point of view, the platform contains all the tools you would ever need when developing robotic applications.
One of the weak points is that the performance of the virtual desktop is pretty bad. Also I struggled with the documentation. For example, I wasnâ€™t able to find an explanation in the documentation on how to move a robot to a specific coordinate, so my robot is currently just moving in a loop
